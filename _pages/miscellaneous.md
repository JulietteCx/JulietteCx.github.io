When I'm not working at the Bank of England or on my PhD, I have tons of hobbies. I love to knit, sew, garden, play the piano, cook (especially French pastries!). I want to use this page to share some of this and some tips I learned along the way. 

The ultimate chocolate cake recipe
==========

I love chocolate cakes. I try to make one for each birthday. For a really long time (and I probably mean for the last ten years) I have been failing at making them as I wanted, i.e. not too sweet, crispy at the top and slightly melting at the bottom. 
After years of experimenting, here's the ultimate recipe:

**Ingredients**
- 200g chocolate (I take it with 70% chocolate)
- 100g butter
- 60g flour
- 3 eggs
- 10g of sugar (literally).


**Steps**
Break the chocolate in tiny pieces. 
Dice the butter in small cubes. 
In a double boiler, melt the chocolate. 
When the chocolate is melted, add small pieces of butter, one after another. 
In the meantime, whip up the eggs (combined, yolk and white together) until the preparation triples in volume. 
When all the butter is incorporated, add the flour to the chocolate preparation (*this is key!).
