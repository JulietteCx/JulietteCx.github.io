        <!-- Chocolate Cake Recipe -->
        <h1>The Ultimate Chocolate Cake Recipe</h1>
        <p>I love chocolate cakes. I try to make one for each birthday. For a really long time (and I probably mean for the last ten years) I have been failing at making them as I wanted, i.e., not too sweet, crispy at the top and slightly melting at the bottom. After years of experimenting, here's the ultimate recipe:</p>
        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('recipe-chocolate')">Toggle Recipe</button>

        <div id="recipe-chocolate" class="hidden">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>200g chocolate (I take it with 70% cocoa)</li>
                <li>100g butter</li>
                <li>60g flour</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>10g of sugar (literally)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <div class="steps">
                <p>1. Preheat the oven in fan mode at 180&deg;C.</p>
                <p>2. Grease a plate (I have a 20cm-squared glass one).</p>
                <p>3. Break the chocolate in tiny pieces.</p>
                <p>4. Dice the butter in small cubes.</p>
                <p>5. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate.</p>
                <p>6. When the chocolate is melted, add small pieces of butter, one after another.</p>
                <p>7. In the meantime, whip up the eggs (combined, yolk and white together) until the preparation triples in volume.</p>
                <p>8. When all the butter is incorporated, add the flour to the chocolate preparation (<em>this is key!</em>).</p>
                <p>9. Combine the two preparations by adding the chocolate mixture to the eggs. Mix very delicately until the preparation is homogenous. Avoid overmixing to prevent the eggs from collapsing.</p>
                <p>10. Pour the preparation into the greased plate.</p>
                <p>11. Bake for 20 minutes, or until you can slide a knife in and it comes out clean.</p>

        <!-- New Recipe (Apple Pie) -->
        <h1>A really cool (French) website for yarn</h1>

        <p>I have never really worried about the ethics of yarn... After all, I was making my clothes instead of buying them, that was already a start. When digging a little bit more on the topic, I learned a lot and would like to share it here, as well as a really cool website that produces yarn ethically!</p>         <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('yarn-webiste')">Toggle Recipe</button>

        <div id="yarn-webiste" class="hidden">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6-8 apples (Granny Smith or a mix of tart apples)</li>
                <li>200g sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1 package of pie crusts (or homemade)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <div class="steps">
                <p>1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</p>
                <p>2. Peel and slice the apples.</p>
                <p>3. In a bowl, mix the apples with sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice.</p>
                <p>4. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish.</p>
                <p>5. Add the apple mixture to the pie crust, dotting with butter on top.</p>
                <p>6. Cover with the second pie crust, sealing the edges and making a few slits for steam to escape.</p>
                <p>7. Bake for 45-50 minutes, until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling.</p>
            </div>
            <p>You're done! Enjoy your apple pie!</p>
